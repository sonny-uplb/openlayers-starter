## Openlayers starter in Next.JS with Tailwind CSS

Need help to fix this!

This started repository has a bug. The Openlayers map has a scrollbar at the right which it should not have and have 2 zoom/in zoom out buttons shown if scrolled down. The whole page should have a sticky header and a footer. The first page should show this map. The height is set to 500px but should be 100% the rest of the page.

Please help
